# hello-world
My first repository

Hello!

I am trying to understand GitHub to get an idea of how to store some applications that I am creating. I am teaching myself the basics of programming, and I want to use it as a hobby to help me with daily tasks. I have some interesting projects I want to tackle, but I am still in the basic learning stages. Hopefully more to come, and I'll be adding to this frequently.
